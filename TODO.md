# To Do

- [ ] Add toast notifications
- [ ] Add proper auth
- [ ] Setup tags (i.e. filter by tag, edit tags, etc.)
- [ ] Add caching / setup ISR
- [x] Password protect delete highlight
- [ ] Handle invalid category or author query params
- [ ] Add error page(s)
- [x] AI-generated summaries for each "content" (store in DB for re-use)
- [ ] See if there's a usecase for the Readwise API "Highlights EXPORT" endpoint
- [x] Add search
- [ ] Try out a state management library (e.g. Zustand)
- [x] Render highlights with heading notes (ex. .h1, .h2, etc.) as actual headings
- [ ] Bug: click Edit button on a highlight > see <form> element in dev tools > `action="javascript:throw new Error('A React form was unexpectedly submitted...')`
- [ ] Automate "Favourites" - currently manually copy-pasting from Readwise
